# Teamwork MCP — Tool Reference

Auto-generated from the registered toolsets by `cmd/docs-gen`. Do not edit by hand — run `go run ./cmd/docs-gen` to regenerate.

This reflects the tools a client actually receives from the shipped servers (`cmd/mcp-http`, `cmd/mcp-stdio`) with writes enabled. **Delete operations are intentionally omitted**: they exist in the codebase but are gated behind an `allowDelete` flag that no shipped server enables, so no client can invoke them. Running a server with `-read-only` removes the write tools, leaving the Get/List operations plus any read-only entries under "Other actions" (e.g. `search`, `summarize_timelogs`, `users_workload`).
